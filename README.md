# FibonacciNumber
A program that calculates Fibonacci numbers up to 300 with different time complexity implementations

I have also implemented a big number data type by myself to support the operation of the fibonacci number calculation<br/>


# Install

To install, simply pull the master branch to download the application.

- For bash shells, you can type `./start.sh` to compile all the classes.</br>
-  For other shells, run: </br>
   - `javac BigNum.java`</br>
   - `javac fibonacci.java`</br>
   - `javac linear.java`</br>
   - `javac naive.java`

# Run

After the classes is compiled, use the command `java naive` to run the naive fibonacci that calculates up to 7. This case takes exponential time.

For linear time, use `java linear` to run the fibonacci calculator that calculates up to 300, with 10 increments.


# Documentation
The entire program is documented in Javadoc format embedded in the java files
